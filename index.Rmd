Hi and welcome!

This website gathers code and additional material for the paper "Unconfounded but Inflated Causal Estimates" by [Vincent Bagilet](https://vincentbagilet.github.io/) and [LÃ©o Zabrocki](https://lzabrocki.github.io/).

The website is under construction and the analysis is still at a preliminary stage.
