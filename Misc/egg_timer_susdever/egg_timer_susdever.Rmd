## Underlying idea

--

- Use causal identification strategies to avoid confounding

--

- They rely on limiting variation

--

- That decreases precision and statistical power

--

- To be significant estimates have to be 2 s.d. away from 0

--

- If power low, they are located in the tails of the distribution

--

- Publication bias $\to$ published estimates may exaggerate true effect

--

- **Trade-off between confounding and exaggeration**

--

- To illustrate this trade-off: simulations

---

## Mechanisms

- RDD: bandwidth size

- IV: "strength" of the instrument

- DiD event studies: number of treated observations

- Matching: caliper

## Hindering the issue

- Report power calculations

- Addressing publication bias
